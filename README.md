## $ About

Personal repository for cheatsheets and guides on it security, pen test and forensic tools.

Plain and simple **white hat** study for noobs like me!

**MIT License** because whatever...

Assume that everything here ran on a [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) machine.

(If by any means you feel embarassed running Kali, you should read about Kali's [undercover mode](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2019-4-release/).)
